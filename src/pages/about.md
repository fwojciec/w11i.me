Hi, my name is **Filip**. I'm a literary agent, a husband and a father. I like to code in what remains of my free time. On this blog I write about coding and books. I also sometimes post things on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/filipcodes).

This blog is created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
Starter theme by [panr](https://radoslawkoziel.pl).
